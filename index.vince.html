    <h3>Neutral Objectives</h3>
        <p>In League of Legends, neutral objectives are powerful monsters on the map that neither team owns, and killing them gives team-wide advantages like permanent bonuses or stronger attacks.
        Teams fight over these objectives because controlling them makes it easier to win battles, take territory, and eventually win the game.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dragon:</strong> Gives permanent, team-wide stat bonuses, with a powerful Dragon Soul after four kills.</li>
            <li><strong>Rift Herald:</strong> Helps destroy enemy towers by charging into them, giving early map control and gold.</li>
            <li><strong>Baron Nashor:</strong> Grants a strong temporary buff that empowers minions and helps teams push and end the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Elder Dragon:</strong> Provides an extremely strong combat buff that quickly finishes enemies and often decides the game.</li>
        </ul>
