            <h2>Neutral Objectives</h2>
                        <p>In League of Legends, neutral objectives are powerful monsters placed on the map that do not belong to either team. When a team defeats one, they receive shared advantages such as permanent stat increases, stronger attacks, or temporary power boosts. These advantages make it easier to win fights, destroy enemy defenses, and control important areas of the map. Because only one team can claim each objective, they become major points of competition. Successfully securing them often determines which team gains momentum and ultimately wins the game.</p>
                <h3>Major Neutral Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dragon:</strong> Gives permanent, team-wide stat bonuses, with a powerful Dragon Soul after four kills.</li>

                            <li><strong>Baron Nashor:</strong> Grants a strong temporary buff that empowers minions and helps teams push and end the game.</li>
                            <li><strong>Elder Dragon:</strong> Provides an extremely strong combat buff that quickly finishes enemies and often decides the game.</li>
